# jlt_worldz — Implementation Memory

Durable decisions, verified API notes, and rationale that should survive across implementation sessions.

## Decisions

- 2026-07-14 — Use `../reseed` as an exact structural/build template, while keeping Worldz gameplay code loader-neutral in `common`. This matches DESIGN.md and minimizes divergence among the sibling mods.
- 2026-07-14 — Keep the existing Fabric gametest run configuration but omit a `fabric-gametest` entrypoint until tests are intentionally added. This is the explicit Phase 0 requirement.
- 2026-07-14 — Do not push commits. The user requested local commits per iteration, and TODO.md reserves publishing decisions for Jason.
- 2026-07-14 — Canonicalize valid config ids to explicit namespaces and deduplicate them in first-seen order. This makes persisted settings stable while preserving the design's order-independent semantics.
- 2026-07-14 — Rewrite successfully parsed config atomically after sanitation, but never rewrite malformed or wrongly typed input. Non-string entries inside `allowedBiomes` are the specified exception: they are warned, dropped, and the otherwise valid file is rewritten.
- 2026-07-14 — In the biome-source codec, `starter_radius` is always encoded and doubles as a resolved-state marker. On decode, an absent starter plus present radius means explicitly disabled; only the fieldless preset consults config for the starter. This preserves config independence for existing worlds without adding a schema field.
- 2026-07-14 — If no allowed biome has an overworld climate entry, delegate to the full overworld parameter list and expose those fallback biomes through `possibleBiomes()`. Reporting an empty possible set would contradict runtime generation and can break structure/feature decisions.

- Phase 0: Gradle composite `build-logic` and multi-project structure — https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/intro_multi_project_builds.html
- Phase 0: Gradle Java toolchains — https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/toolchains.html
- Phase 1: Gson malformed-input behavior and strict JSON diagnostics — https://github.com/google/gson/blob/main/Troubleshooting.md
- Phase 1: Gson object serialization/deserialization API — https://github.com/google/gson
- Phase 2: Fabric codec patterns and registry dispatch — https://docs.fabricmc.net/develop/serialization/codecs
- Phase 2: Fabric built-in registry registration pattern — https://docs.fabricmc.net/develop/items/custom-data-components
- Phase 2: NeoForge deferred codec registration pattern — https://docs.neoforged.net/docs/1.21.1/worldgen/biomemodifier/
- Phase 2: Authoritative Minecraft 26.2 generated sources — `common/build/moddev/artifacts/vanilla-26.2-1-sources.jar`

## Verification Log

- 2026-07-14 / Phase 0 — `./gradlew build` succeeded across `common`, `fabric`, and `neoforge` on Temurin 25. No tests exist yet. Javadoc emitted only missing-comment warnings; Gradle reported template/plugin deprecations affecting eventual Gradle 10 compatibility.
- 2026-07-14 / Phase 1 — `./gradlew build` succeeded across both loaders with 16 JUnit tests covering config creation/fallback/tolerance/filtering/clamping, biome/tag parsing, canonicalization, and starter-zone boundary/overflow math.
- 2026-07-14 / Phase 2 — `./gradlew build` succeeded with `LimitedBiomeSource` compiled into both Fabric and NeoForge artifacts. Codec/preset runtime decoding remains assigned to the Phase 3 launch and Phase 4 smoke tests as specified by the design.

## API Deviations

- Minecraft 26.2 uses `net.minecraft.resources.Identifier` where the design sketch says `ResourceLocation`.
- Fabric's concrete codec registry is `BuiltInRegistries.BIOME_SOURCE`; `Registries.BIOME_SOURCE` is its registry key.
- See the starter-radius resolved marker and fail-safe possible-biome decisions above.
