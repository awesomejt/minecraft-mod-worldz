# jlt_worldz — Implementation Memory

Durable decisions, verified API notes, and rationale that should survive across implementation sessions.

## Decisions

- 2026-07-14 — Use `../reseed` as an exact structural/build template, while keeping Worldz gameplay code loader-neutral in `common`. This matches DESIGN.md and minimizes divergence among the sibling mods.
- 2026-07-14 — Keep the existing Fabric gametest run configuration but omit a `fabric-gametest` entrypoint until tests are intentionally added. This is the explicit Phase 0 requirement.
- 2026-07-14 — Do not push commits. The user requested local commits per iteration, and TODO.md reserves publishing decisions for Jason.
- 2026-07-14 — Canonicalize valid config ids to explicit namespaces and deduplicate them in first-seen order. This makes persisted settings stable while preserving the design's order-independent semantics.
- 2026-07-14 — Rewrite successfully parsed config atomically after sanitation, but never rewrite malformed or wrongly typed input. Non-string entries inside `allowedBiomes` are the specified exception: they are warned, dropped, and the otherwise valid file is rewritten.
- 2026-07-14 — In the biome-source codec, `starter_radius` is always encoded and doubles as a resolved-state marker. On decode, an absent starter plus present radius means explicitly disabled; only the fieldless preset consults config for the starter. This preserves config independence for existing worlds without adding a schema field.
- 2026-07-14 — If no allowed biome has an overworld climate entry, delegate to the full overworld parameter list and expose those fallback biomes through `possibleBiomes()`. Reporting an empty possible set would contradict runtime generation and can break structure/feature decisions.
- 2026-07-14 — Build overworld climate parameters with `new MultiNoiseBiomeSourceParameterList(Preset.OVERWORLD, biomeGetter)` during codec decode. Retrieving the parameter-list registry holder fails in 26.2 because world presets are decoded while that holder is still unbound by parallel registry loading.
- 2026-07-14 — Expand configured biome tags lazily on first biome-source use.
  Minecraft 26.2 decodes world presets before dynamic-registry tags are bound;
  eager `HolderSet.Named.stream()` access prevents datapacks from loading. The
  memoized resolution is encoded as a direct holder list in world-gen settings.
- 2026-07-14 — Extract climate-entry selection into the pure generic
  `AllowedEntryFilter`. This keeps every climate point for an allowed biome,
  preserves vanilla entry order, separately tracks distinct matched biomes,
  and makes the core filtering behavior directly testable without booting
  Minecraft registries.
- 2026-07-14 — Use MIT as specified by DESIGN.md and loader metadata. The
  reseed template unexpectedly supplied CC0; the completion audit replaced it
  with the SPDX MIT text attributed to Jason Taylor and added metadata tests.
- 2026-07-14 — For non-fallback generation, expose only climate-matched allowed
  holders through `possibleBiomes()`. Unsupported configured biomes are warned
  and ignored, so advertising them to feature/structure logic would contradict
  what the delegate can generate.
- 2026-07-14 — Switch the canonical config to `jlt_worldz.yaml` at the user's
  request. Use SnakeYAML 2.6's `SafeConstructor` and manually validate a plain
  map/list/scalar tree rather than constructing Java beans. If YAML is absent,
  a valid legacy JSON config is parsed as YAML-compatible input, written to
  YAML, and retained as `.json.bak`; malformed input remains untouched.
- 2026-07-14 — Limited-world borders use Minecraft's vanilla square border,
  centered at `(0,0)`, with config values expressed as center-to-side radii.
  Overworld and Nether schedules are independent and disabled by default.
  Initial/final radii plus `resizeDays` express static, growing, and shrinking
  borders. Optional progression objectives need to be reachable at the final
  size (up to the requested reference of 100 in-game days), not on day zero.

## Verification Log

- 2026-07-14 / Phase 0 — `./gradlew build` succeeded across `common`, `fabric`, and `neoforge` on Temurin 25. No tests exist yet. Javadoc emitted only missing-comment warnings; Gradle reported template/plugin deprecations affecting eventual Gradle 10 compatibility.
- 2026-07-14 / Phase 1 — `./gradlew build` succeeded across both loaders with 16 JUnit tests covering config creation/fallback/tolerance/filtering/clamping, biome/tag parsing, canonicalization, and starter-zone boundary/overflow math.
- 2026-07-14 / Phase 2 — `./gradlew build` succeeded with `LimitedBiomeSource` compiled into both Fabric and NeoForge artifacts. Codec/preset runtime decoding remains assigned to the Phase 3 launch and Phase 4 smoke tests as specified by the design.
- 2026-07-14 / Phase 3 — 20 JUnit tests passed, including exact preset/tag/lang structure checks. Fabric reached title-screen resource reload. Isolated Fabric and NeoForge servers each created, prepared spawn for, saved, and cleanly stopped a fresh `level-type=jlt_worldz:worldz` world. Visual create-screen dropdown confirmation remains a human check.
- 2026-07-14 / Runtime config coverage — A Fabric server created a world from
  `#minecraft:is_overworld` after lazy tag expansion fixed the verified 26.2
  tag-binding lifecycle failure. Fabric and NeoForge also created and saved
  plains worlds with a 512-block cherry-grove starter zone; their saved
  `world_gen_settings.dat` files contain the resolved biome, starter, radius,
  and `jlt_worldz:limited` type.
- 2026-07-14 / Config isolation — The Fabric starter world reopened after the
  global config changed to desert with no starter. Its saved settings remained
  plains + cherry, `locate biome` found cherry at the origin and plains 520
  blocks away, and the server stopped cleanly.
- 2026-07-14 / JUnit hardening — The common suite increased from 20 to 31
  passing tests. New coverage directly verifies climate-entry filtering
  (including duplicate parameter entries and immutable results), malformed
  field types, empty allowed lists, docs sanitation, summaries, null parser
  inputs, immutable parser results, exact diagonal/zero-radius zone boundaries,
  and exact preset/tag/lang resource membership.
- 2026-07-14 / Completion audit — Found and corrected a real license mismatch:
  root `LICENSE` was CC0 while the design and loader manifests declared MIT.
  Two project-metadata tests now lock the license, root project name, package
  group, mod identity, version, Java level, and Minecraft version. The suite
  now contains 33 tests.
- 2026-07-14 / YAML migration — Replaced the runtime Gson config parser with a
  safe map-based YAML parser/emitter and added JSON-to-YAML migration. Focused
  config tests cover defaults, sanitation, type failures, precedence, legacy
  backup, and preservation of malformed YAML/JSON. Both loader artifacts embed
  the parser dependency, attribution notice, and full Apache-2.0 license. A
  clean `./gradlew clean build` and the final `./gradlew build` passed with 37
  JUnit tests; jar inspection confirmed SnakeYAML and license resources in both
  loader artifacts.

## API Deviations

- Minecraft 26.2 uses `net.minecraft.resources.Identifier` where the design sketch says `ResourceLocation`.
- Fabric's concrete codec registry is `BuiltInRegistries.BIOME_SOURCE`; `Registries.BIOME_SOURCE` is its registry key.
- The codec retrieves only the biome registry getter; it constructs the public vanilla overworld preset parameter list directly to avoid 26.2's parallel-load unbound holder.
- Configured tag holder sets are expanded only after tag binding, then persisted
  as a resolved direct holder list.
- Minecraft 26.2 stores codec-encoded dimension settings in
  `data/minecraft/world_gen_settings.dat`, not directly in `level.dat`.
- Loader jars use the reseed naming convention rather than a single root
  `mod-worldz` archive because Fabric and NeoForge require distinct artifacts.
- See the starter-radius resolved marker and fail-safe possible-biome decisions above.
