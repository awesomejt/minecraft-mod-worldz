# jlt_worldz — Implementation Memory

Durable decisions, verified API notes, and rationale that should survive across implementation sessions.

## Decisions

- 2026-07-14 — Use `../reseed` as an exact structural/build template, while keeping Worldz gameplay code loader-neutral in `common`. This matches DESIGN.md and minimizes divergence among the sibling mods.
- 2026-07-14 — Keep the existing Fabric gametest run configuration but omit a `fabric-gametest` entrypoint until tests are intentionally added. This is the explicit Phase 0 requirement.
- 2026-07-14 — Do not push commits. The user requested local commits per iteration, and TODO.md reserves publishing decisions for Jason.

## Reference Log

- Phase 0: Fabric project structure and `fabric.mod.json` entrypoints — https://docs.fabricmc.net/develop/getting-started/project-structure
- Phase 0: Gradle composite `build-logic` and multi-project structure — https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/intro_multi_project_builds.html
- Phase 0: Gradle Java toolchains — https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/toolchains.html

## Verification Log

- 2026-07-14 / Phase 0 — `./gradlew build` succeeded across `common`, `fabric`, and `neoforge` on Temurin 25. No tests exist yet. Javadoc emitted only missing-comment warnings; Gradle reported template/plugin deprecations affecting eventual Gradle 10 compatibility.

## API Deviations

- None recorded yet.
